# Warrior Tools

## Overview
Warrior Tools is an e-commerce website designed to serve construction professionals and DIY enthusiasts with a curated selection of high-quality tools. This project brings together my real-world experience in the construction industry and the technical skills I've gained during my time at the Code Institute.

As someone currently working in construction, tools aren't just products to me‚Äîthey're essential, everyday companions on the job. I wanted to create a platform that not only showcases the tools I know and trust, but also demonstrates how practical, hands-on knowledge can be translated into a functional and user-friendly web application.

Building Warrior Tools allowed me to fuse my passion for construction with my growing skills in web development, resulting in a website that feels authentic, useful, and personal. From the product pages to the checkout experience, every part of the site was built with both the user and the tradesperson in mind.

## üè¢ Business Type

Warrior Tools currently operates as a B2C (Business to Consumer) e-commerce platform, catering to individuals working in construction, trades, and DIY markets. The platform is designed to provide:

- High-quality, trusted tool brands

- A user-friendly interface for quick and secure purchasing

- Efficient navigation and product filtering for professionals on the go

While the site is presently geared toward individual consumers, it is built with scalability in mind. There is a clear roadmap for evolving Warrior Tools into a B2B (Business to Business) model‚Äîserving construction firms, contractors, and trade suppliers with bulk ordering, trade accounts, and personalized procurement solutions.

This future adaptability makes Warrior Tools not just a final project, but the foundation of a real, scalable business opportunity.
