## Overview
Warrior Tools is an e-commerce website designed to serve construction professionals and DIY enthusiasts with a curated selection of high-quality tools. This project brings together my real-world experience in the construction industry and the technical skills I've gained during my time at the Code Institute.

As someone currently working in construction, tools aren't just products to me‚Äîthey're essential, everyday companions on the job. I wanted to create a platform that not only showcases the tools I know and trust, but also demonstrates how practical, hands-on knowledge can be translated into a functional and user-friendly web application.

Building Warrior Tools allowed me to fuse my passion for construction with my growing skills in web development, resulting in a website that feels authentic, useful, and personal. From the product pages to the checkout experience, every part of the site was built with both the user and the tradesperson in mind.

## üè¢ Business Type

Warrior Tools currently operates as a B2C (Business to Consumer) e-commerce platform, catering to individuals working in construction, trades, and DIY markets. The platform is designed to provide:

- High-quality, trusted tool brands

- A user-friendly interface for quick and secure purchasing

- Efficient navigation and product filtering for professionals on the go

While the site is presently geared toward individual consumers, it is built with scalability in mind. There is a clear roadmap for evolving Warrior Tools into a B2B (Business to Business) model‚Äîserving construction firms, contractors, and trade suppliers with bulk ordering, trade accounts, and personalized procurement solutions.

This future adaptability makes Warrior Tools not just a final project, but the foundation of a real, scalable business opportunity.

## üìà Content Planning & SEO Strategy

#### üìÑ views.py
index(request)

Renders the homepage template (index.html)

Does not contain dynamic logic ‚Äî simply returns the main entry point to the site

#### üìÑ models.py
Empty ‚Äî this app does not use any database models, as it's purely for static/static-like content

#### üìÑ urls.py
Maps the root URL (/) to the index view

May also include other static routes like /about/ or /contact/ if added

#### üìÑ admin.py
Empty (or default) ‚Äî no models to register

#### üìÑ apps.py
Default app configuration generated by Django

#### üìù Summary
The home app serves as the user‚Äôs first interaction with Warrior Tools. It renders static pages and sets up the structure for marketing content. Its simplicity and separation from business logic ensure clean routing and maintainability.

### products App
The products app is responsible for displaying, filtering, and managing the tools available on the Warrior Tools eCommerce platform.

#### üîç models.py
This file defines two key models:

Category

Stores product categories with a name and optional friendly_name for display.

Includes a custom plural name ("Categories") and a helper method get_friendly_name().

Product

Represents each tool with fields like name, sku, description, price, rating, and image.

Supports optional size selection via has_sizes.

Categorizes products using a ForeignKey to Category.

Defines VARIANT_CHOICES (e.g., hammer, jigsaw, orbital sander) to help distinguish product types.

#### üìÑ views.py
This file contains the main logic for product display and search functionality:

all_products(request)

Displays all products with optional filtering by category, search term, and sorting (e.g., name or category).

Supports GET parameters:

sort (e.g., name, category)

direction (asc, desc)

q (search query)

category (comma-separated filter)

Other views (not fully shown in preview) likely include:

Individual product detail display

Admin-only product management (if applicable)

#### üßæ Other Files
forms.py ‚Äì Manages forms for creating/editing products (via ProductForm)

admin.py ‚Äì Registers Product and Category in the Django admin

urls.py ‚Äì Maps URLs like /products/ and /products/<product_id>/ to view functions

### üß© bag App
The bag app handles all functionality related to the shopping cart (referred to as the "bag" on the site).

#### üìÑ models.py
This file is intentionally empty. The cart does not persist to the database but instead uses Django sessions to store items temporarily until checkout.

#### üìÑ views.py
This file contains key view functions for shopping cart behavior:

view_bag(request)
Renders the shopping bag page showing all current items stored in the session.

add_to_bag(request, item_id)
Adds a product to the session-based bag, with logic to:

Handle items with or without sizes

Update quantities if an item already exists

Store items using nested dictionaries under the session key "bag"

adjust_bag(request, item_id) (not in preview but expected)
Adjusts the quantity of a product already in the bag.

remove_from_bag(request, item_id) (expected)
Removes a product from the session cart entirely.

#### üß† Additional Logic
contexts.py
Provides a context processor that makes bag contents and totals available across all templates. This is essential for rendering the cart icon/total in the navbar.

templatetags/
May include custom template filters (if implemented) to assist with bag rendering.

#### üßæ Summary
This app is a self-contained module that leverages session storage for cart logic. It's an example of lightweight, scalable design for managing transient user data without the overhead of database models.

### üß© checkout App
The checkout app manages the full order processing flow, including collecting shipping information, calculating totals, and integrating with Stripe for secure payments.

#### üìÑ models.py
Two main models are defined:

Order

Stores all key information for a customer order including:

Contact details (full_name, email, phone_number)

Shipping information (country, postcode, address)

Order metadata (date, delivery cost, total, grand total)

Reference to the logged-in user via a ForeignKey to UserProfile

Automatically assigns a unique order_number using UUID

Contains helper methods to update the order total and calculate grand total dynamically

OrderLineItem (just beyond preview, but typically included)

Linked to the Order via a ForeignKey

Stores individual product, quantity, line item total, and optional size variant

Together, these models form the backbone of the order tracking and checkout pipeline.

### üß© profiles App
The profiles app handles user-specific data and settings. It allows authenticated users to:

View and update their saved delivery information

See past orders

Manage wishlist items

It integrates closely with the checkout, products, and Django User models.

#### üìÑ models.py
UserProfile

One-to-one relationship with Django‚Äôs User model

Stores default delivery info (name, phone, address, country)

Signal:

A @receiver(post_save) function listens for changes to the User model:

Automatically creates a UserProfile when a new user is registered

Updates the profile if an existing User is saved

This logic is built directly into models.py, so there is no separate signals.py file in this app.

#### üìÑ views.py
profile(request)

Displays and processes the profile form

Pre-fills with existing delivery info from the UserProfile

Also fetches:

Related orders (profile.orders.all())

Wishlist items (request.user.wishlist_items)

order_history(request, order_number)

Allows users to view past order details from their profile

Reuses the checkout success template to show full order breakdown

#### üìÑ forms.py
Defines the UserProfileForm

Allows users to update name, address, phone number, and country

Used in the profile view for both GET and POST requests

#### üìÑ urls.py
Routes user requests to:

/profile/ ‚Üí Profile view

/profile/orders/<order_number>/ ‚Üí Order history detail view

#### üìÑ admin.py
Registers UserProfile with the Django admin site

Useful for backend review of user delivery settings

#### üìù Summary
The profiles app extends Django's user model to support a personalised shopping experience. By storing default delivery information and linking to past orders and wishlist items, it streamlines the checkout process and offers users a centralized profile dashboard. Core functionality is delivered through a combination of views, a form, and a signal‚Äîall working together to maintain an up-to-date user profile automatically.

### üß© newsletter App
The newsletter app manages email subscriptions from site visitors who want to receive updates, new tool announcements, and helpful usage tips in the future.

It provides a simple but scalable foundation for email marketing.

#### üìÑ models.py
NewsletterSubscriber

Stores the email address of each subscriber (enforced as unique)

Automatically records the subscription timestamp using date_joined

Provides a string representation returning the subscriber‚Äôs email

#### üìÑ views.py
Handles:

Display and submission of the newsletter signup form

Success and error feedback using Django messages

#### üìÑ forms.py
Defines a simple form (NewsletterForm) to collect a single EmailField

Validates that the email is not already subscribed

#### üìÑ email.py
Likely handles custom email logic (e.g., sending a welcome message or preparing future campaigns)

Can be integrated with services like SendGrid or Mailchimp in the future

#### üìÑ urls.py
Maps routes like /newsletter/subscribe/ to the appropriate view

#### üìÑ admin.py
Registers NewsletterSubscriber so subscriptions can be viewed or managed via the Django admin panel

#### üìù Summary
The newsletter app enables users to subscribe to email updates. It is designed with simplicity and extendibility in mind‚Äîready to be paired with email delivery services for future campaigns. It uses clean models, a reusable form, and straightforward views to integrate with any section of the site (e.g., homepage footer or modal pop-up).

### üß© testimonials App
The testimonials app allows users to submit reviews or feedback about the site, which can then be reviewed and published by an admin. This builds trust and social proof for potential customers.

### üìÑ models.py
Testimonial

Stores individual testimonials with the following fields:

author: ForeignKey to User

content: The user-submitted feedback text

rating: Integer from 1 to 5 (with dropdown choices)

created_at: Timestamp of when the testimonial was submitted

approved: Boolean to control whether it‚Äôs published

Only approved testimonials should be displayed on the front end.

### üìÑ views.py

Displaying approved testimonials

Handling testimonial submission by authenticated users

Likely includes a view to thank the user or confirm submission

### üìÑ forms.py
Defines a form for users to submit:

Rating

Feedback content

Includes basic validation to ensure proper input format and optional custom error messages.

### üìÑ urls.py
Maps URLs like /testimonials/ and /testimonials/submit/ to the respective views

### üìÑ admin.py
Registers the Testimonial model

Enables staff to approve or reject submissions before they go live

### üìù Summary
The testimonials app gives users a voice and provides potential customers with authentic reviews. Featuring moderation tools for admins and a clean model-view-form pattern, it enhances both credibility and user engagement on the site.

## üí≥ Stripe Payment Integration
Stripe is used to securely handle payment processing on the Warrior Tools website. It enables customers to make real-time payments using debit or credit cards with confidence.

### üîê Why Stripe?
PCI-compliant and secure by design

No sensitive card data stored on the site

Simple integration via JavaScript and Django backend

Allows real-time validation and error handling

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Stripe Is Integrated
Frontend (JS & HTML):

Stripe‚Äôs JavaScript SDK is used to capture payment details securely.

A custom checkout form is rendered using Stripe Elements (in checkout/templates/checkout/checkout.html).

Real-time card validation and error messages are handled client-side.

Backend (Django):

On form submission, a Stripe PaymentIntent is created via Stripe‚Äôs Python SDK.

The client_secret is returned to the frontend to complete the transaction.

Metadata (such as the contents of the cart and the user info) is attached to the PaymentIntent via the cache_checkout_data view.

Webhooks:

The webhooks.py and webhook_handler.py files listen for payment success or failure events.

When a payment_intent.succeeded webhook is received:

An order is finalized in the database.

A confirmation email is sent to the user.

The cart is cleared from the session.

### üß™ Testing Stripe in Dev Mode
Test card number for development:

Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242

Expiry: Any future date

CVC: Any 3-digit number

Postal Code: Any value

Stripe is currently running in test mode, with live keys to be added before production.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS S3 & Media File Storage
Warrior Tools uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) ‚Äî specifically S3 (Simple Storage Service) ‚Äî to manage and serve static and media files in a production environment.

This ensures scalability, reliability, and fast delivery of assets like product images, CSS, and JavaScript.

### üîß What AWS Services Are Used
Amazon S3

Stores and serves static files (CSS, JS) and user-uploaded media (e.g. product images)

Configured with two buckets:

One for static files (pre-collected via collectstatic)

One for media files (uploaded by admins or users)

Buckets are made public-read for safe, direct browser access

AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management)

A dedicated IAM user was created for this project

Permissions restricted to only allow access to the S3 buckets

Access and secret keys stored securely in env.py and on Heroku as config vars

AWS CloudFront (optional enhancement)

Can be used for CDN delivery if project scales further

### ‚öôÔ∏è Django Configuration
custom_storages.py

Defines two storage backends:

StaticStorage: For static files

MediaStorage: For uploaded media

These are referenced in settings.py using:

python
Copy code
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
boto3 and django-storages

Installed via requirements.txt

Handle file upload and retrieval to/from S3 programmatically

###¬†üîê Security Considerations
AWS credentials are never committed to Git ‚Äî they are stored in env.py and Heroku config vars

S3 buckets use strict permissions with no public write access

Media URLs are safely served via S3 links, reducing load on the Heroku dyno

###¬†üß™ Local vs Production
Local Development:

Uses Django‚Äôs default static and media storage on the local file system

Production (Heroku + AWS):

Automatically switches to S3 for file handling using environment variables

##¬†üìß Email Integration
Warrior Tools uses email in three key areas to keep users informed and secure:

Order confirmations after checkout

Newsletter subscriptions and unsubscriptions

Account registration email verification

These emails are handled using Django‚Äôs send_mail() function, secure SMTP backend, and context-driven templates.

### üõí 1. Order Confirmation Emails
Triggered automatically after successful payment via Stripe.

Includes:

Order reference

Product summary

Delivery address

Templates:

confirmation_email_subject.txt

confirmation_email_body.txt

### üì® 2. Newsletter Subscription Emails
‚úÖ On Subscription:

User email is added to NewsletterSubscriber model

Sends a welcome/confirmation email outlining:

What they‚Äôll receive (e.g., new tool announcements, usage tips)

‚ùå On Unsubscription:

Email is deleted from the system

A confirmation email is sent to notify the user they‚Äôve successfully unsubscribed

###¬†üîë 3. Email Verification on Signup
When a new user registers, a verification email is sent.

The email includes a unique activation link.

The account remains inactive until the user verifies their email via the link.

This helps:

Prevent spam/bot signups

Confirm user identity

Ensure email deliverability for order receipts

Note: If you‚Äôre using packages like django-allauth or a custom token system, mention it here.

###¬†‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
SMTP via Gmail or compatible service

Email settings securely loaded from environment variables:

python
Copy code
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASS')
Local testing uses Django‚Äôs console.EmailBackend

Production delivery confirmed with real inboxes

### üß™ Testing Summary
All email flows tested manually:

Order confirmation

Newsletter subscribe/unsubscribe

Email verification on account signup

Confirmed email content is rendered correctly with user-specific data

Invalid email scenarios handled gracefully

## üîê Environment Variables & Security
Warrior Tools follows security best practices by separating sensitive configuration data from the codebase using environment variables. This approach protects secret keys, credentials, and tokens from being exposed in version control or the public domain.

### üìÅ env.py for Local Development
A local env.py file is used to store all sensitive keys and configuration values. This file is excluded from version control using .gitignore.

Sample structure of env.py:

python
Copy code
import os

os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret-django-key"
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "your-test-stripe-public-key"
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-test-stripe-secret-key"
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "your-stripe-webhook-secret"
os.environ["EMAIL_HOST_USER"] = "your-email@gmail.com"
os.environ["EMAIL_HOST_PASS"] = "your-app-password"
os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = "your-aws-key"
os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = "your-aws-secret"
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "your-postgres-url"
‚òÅÔ∏è Heroku Configuration
In production, all of these values are set securely in the Heroku Config Vars section (under Settings ‚Üí Reveal Config Vars). This includes:

SECRET_KEY

STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

STRIPE_WH_SECRET

EMAIL_HOST_USER

EMAIL_HOST_PASS

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

USE_AWS (a custom flag to enable AWS S3 in production)

DATABASE_URL (Heroku's PostgreSQL database URL)

These are accessed in settings.py using:

python
Copy code
import os

SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")
üîí Git Ignore & Security Measures
The following files and directories are explicitly excluded from Git via .gitignore:

env.py

.env (if used)

.venv/

Any local DB or system-specific files

Credentials and access keys are never hardcoded into the codebase or templates.

### Summary
Using environment variables ensures Warrior Tools is secure, portable, and production-ready. It separates code from configuration, allows safe deployment via Heroku, and supports secret rotation and CI/CD practices.

## üöÄ Heroku Deployment
