# üß™ Testing Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy, procedures, and outcomes for the Warrior Tools e-commerce platform. The goal of testing was to ensure that the site functions reliably across all major features, meets user expectations, adheres to best practices for code quality and accessibility, and is free from critical bugs or regressions.

The testing process included:

‚úÖ Manual Testing of all user-facing functionality, including registration, product browsing, wishlist, checkout, profile management, testimonials, and newsletter subscription.

‚úÖ Cross-Browser and Device Testing to verify consistent performance and responsiveness across modern web browsers and common screen sizes.

‚úÖ Validation of HTML, CSS, and Accessibility using industry-standard tools such as W3C Validators and Chrome DevTools.

‚úÖ Lighthouse Auditing for performance, best practices, and accessibility scores.

‚úÖ Bug Tracking and Fixes, with documentation of the cause and resolution of any issues discovered during development or QA.

‚úÖ Code Quality Enforcement through automatic formatting and linting using Black and Flake8.

## üß™ Manual Testing
Manual testing was conducted to ensure that each core feature of Warrior Tools behaves as expected under typical user interactions. The testing covered the full user journey from account creation to checkout, as well as administrative and edge-case scenarios.

Each journey was repeated in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and screen sizes to confirm consistent performance.

## üß™ Responsive Behaviour Highlights
Navigation menus collapse appropriately on mobile and expand on desktop.

Product cards and checkout forms scale fluidly.

Font sizes and icons adapt well for readability.

Hover and click actions translate to touch events correctly on mobile devices.

## üî¶ Lighthouse Testing

Lighthouse audits were conducted across multiple pages of the Warrior Tools website using Chrome DevTools in both **mobile** and **desktop** simulation modes. These audits evaluated the site for:

- **Performance**
- **Accessibility**
- **Best Practices**
- **SEO**

### üì± Mobile Audit

![Lighthouse Mobile Report](docs/lighthouse2.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* The mobile performance scores was lower due to a slow-loading test environment. Lighthouse reported that "the page loaded too slowly to finish within the time limit." This may reflect test conditions more than actual site speed.

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Audit

![Lighthouse Desktop Report](docs/lighthouse1.png)

This result reflects performance under standard conditions for the homepage, product list, and checkout flow.

### ‚úÖ Summary & Future Improvements

All major screens were tested manually via Lighthouse, with consistently strong scores in **accessibility**, **SEO**, and **best practices**.

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Optimize image formats and enable lazy loading
- Improve server response times for mobile
- Minimize unused JavaScript
- Explore CDN options for faster delivery

These steps should improve performance scores further and enhance the user experience across all devices.

## ‚úÖ HTML Validation
All HTML files were validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service. The following observations were made:

- [HTML Validation](docs/screenshots/html-val.png)
- [HTML Warnings](docs/screenshots/html-warnings.png)

## ‚úÖ CSS Validation

- [CSS Validation](docs/screenshots/css-val.png)

## ‚úÖ CSS Validation

- [JS Validation](docs/screenshots/js-val.png)

## ‚ôø Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests were conducted to ensure inclusivity and proper semantic markup:

- WAVE browser extension used to scan home, product, and checkout pages
- All pages passed with no major errors
- All form fields include `label` tags or `aria-labels`
- Colour contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Keyboard navigation tested for:
  - Navigation bar
  - Product detail pages
  - Checkout and forms


## Bugs and Fixes
### üêû Bug Summary
product detail page displays a ‚Äúsize‚Äù (voltage) option for hand tools like screwdrivers, which should not have any selectable size.

Cause: 
product.has_sizes is set to True
product.variant_type is set to a value like "drill", triggering the voltage dropdown

Fix:
To resolve the issue, the product‚Äôs data was corrected by updating its attributes:
The has_sizes field was set to false to indicate the product does not require selectable sizes.
The variant_type field was cleared to prevent voltage options from being triggered by mistake.

### üêû Bug Summary
The "Free delivery on orders over ¬£X!" message was not appearing in the header across the site, even though it previously worked.

Cause:
In base.html, the template was referencing {{ free_shipping_threshold }}, but the correct context variable from bag.contexts.bag_contents is free_delivery_threshold.

Fix: 
After replacing free_shipping_threshold with free_delivery_threshold, the banner now shows correctly across the site as expected.

### üêõ Bug Summary
I was receiving a payment_intent.succeeded webhook from Stripe, but the Django webhook handler was returning a 500 error. The issue was that the code tried to access the charges property directly from the Stripe PaymentIntent object, assuming it was always present.

Cause: 
In some cases‚Äîespecially in test mode or depending on the Stripe API version‚Äîcharges is not included in the webhook payload. This caused an AttributeError, breaking the webhook and preventing it from processing the order.

Fix:
To make the webhook handler more reliable, I updated the code to:
First attempt to access the charges data from the webhook payload directly (which is faster and doesn't require an API call).
If charges is not available, fall back to retrieving the charge details using the latest_charge ID via the Stripe API.

### üêõ Bug Summary
While working on my Django Stripe integration, I encountered a persistent HTTP 500 error triggered by the payment_intent.succeeded webhook from Stripe. It turned out to be caused by assumptions I made in the webhook handler.

Cause:
The webhook handler was trying to access billing_details.email directly from intent.charges.data[0], but in some cases, that field wasn‚Äôt present in the webhook payload. When that happened, the code threw an AttributeError or failed due to a missing required field (email) for order creation.

I also didn‚Äôt have proper fallback logic in place to retrieve the email from other possible sources, like intent.receipt_email, nor did I safeguard against missing charges.

Fix:
To resolve the issue, I added robust fallback logic in the webhook handler to check if charges exist and safely pull the email address. If the billing email is missing, it now falls back to receipt_email. I also added a guard clause to return a clean error response if an email still isn‚Äôt found, avoiding a crash. This fixed the 500 error, and Stripe webhooks are now being handled successfully.

### üêû Bug Summary
The ‚ÄúWrenches & Pliers‚Äù category did not display any products when selected from the Hand Tools dropdown menu, even though products existed and showed up via search.

Cause:
The dropdown link was using an outdated category query string:
?category=wrenches
However, the actual category name (slug) in the database was updated to wrenches_and_pliers, resulting in no match and an empty product list.

Fix:
The dropdown link was corrected to use the updated category slug:
The link in main-nav.html was changed from ?category=wrenches to ?category=wrenches_and_pliers.
The combined ‚ÄúAll Hand Tools‚Äù link was also updated to include wrenches_and_pliers in the list of categories.

### üêû Bug Summary
Customers occasionally experienced duplicate orders when completing a purchase on the live site. Two identical orders would appear in the admin and confirmation emails, despite only one payment being made.

Cause:
In production, the checkout form was being submitted more than once due to frontend behavior and network conditions. This led to the backend order creation logic running multiple times before the session or payment metadata could prevent it.

Fix:
A backend check was added to detect if an order with the same user details, cart contents, and payment ID already exists. If a matching order is found, the system redirects the user to the original confirmation page instead of creating a new order.

### Code Style
- Flake8 was used for linting with a `.flake8` config file
- Black was used for autoformatting (88 character line length)
- All code passes linting except for lines longer than 88 where readability benefits

- Stripe integration tested in sandbox mode
- Responsive design confirmed across devices
- HTML, CSS, and JS passed W3C validation
- Accessibility issues resolved
